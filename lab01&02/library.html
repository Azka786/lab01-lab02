    <p>In year two, teachers at five middle and high school sites provided Saturdaremote learning sessions to support the targeted students in learning how to create artificial intelligence (AI) voice-enabled chatbots using a project-based approach to solve culturally-relevant problems in student homes, schools, and communities. The project has also provided teacher professional development in IBM Watson’s AI assistant (chatbot), artificial intelligence, special education strategies, universal design, and project-based learning. As a result of this project, African American and Hispanic students with disabilities in secondary schools are learning to be creators of artificial intelligence innovations for social justice, rather than just consumers of technology.

        In year three, we are working to identify solutions to broadening the participation of African American and Hispanic students with disabilities in computer science education. We are also addressing the importance of elevating issues of racial equity and the intersectionality of race and disability for African American and Hispanic Students with disabilities. Computing and special education teachers again teamed up to implement after school and/or Saturday sessions to support the targeted students in learning how to create artificial intelligence (AI) voice chatbot projects for social justice. The projects teachers and students have earned IBM digital badges (micro credentials) that demonstrate understanding of creating chatbots by leveraging IBM Watson. Then, teams of students are designing AI voice-enabled chatbot projects to solve student-selected social justice problems for their friends, families, and community members. The Design Justice principles provided guidance to create AI voice chatbot projects led by marginalized communities to dismantle structural inequality and to advance collective liberation and survival for African American and Hispanic people.</p>
    <h3 id="EE-intro">Electrical Engineering</h3>
    <p>Electrical engineering (sometimes referred to as electrical and electronic engineering) is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century with the commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply. The field now covers a range of sub-disciplines including those that deal with power, optoelectronics, digital electronics, analog electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, control systems, electronics, signal processing and telecommunications.

        The term electrical engineering may or may not encompass electronic engineering. Where a distinction is made, electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with large-scale electrical systems such as power transmission and motor control, whereas electronic engineering deals with the study of small-scale electronic systems including computers and integrated circuits. Another way of looking at the distinction is that electrical engineers are usually concerned with using electricity to transmit energy, while electronics engineers are concerned with using electricity to transmit information.</p>
    <h3 id="archtect-intro">Architect</h3>
    <p>Among the participants in the first ANY (Architecture New York) conference, organized by Peter Eisenman and Cynthia Davidson in 1991, was the novelist William Gibson, author of the cyberpunk classic Neuromancer. Published in 1984, Neuromancer captured the anxieties of a dystopian world in which technology has penetrated all aspects of everyday life. In Gibson’s early novels, unprecedented physical mobility and the fluidity of personal identity enabled by digital technologies reshape individual subjectivity and the physical space of the city alike — which is perhaps why the author found himself in Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1990s speaking to the group of architects, philosophers, literary critics and architectural theorists assembled by Eisenman and Davidson. Like the film Blade Runner two years earlier, Neuromancer had become an early touchstone for imaginative speculation on the urban and architectural consequences of digital culture.

        More recently, Gibsons keen cultural antennae have detected another shift. In three novels published since the beginning of the 21st century, Gibson has continued to explore similar themes, but now in novels set not in the future but in the present. 2 Fashion, underground marketing, industrial espionage, hacker culture and the shadowy workings of international capital are the subjects of these recent novels. Locations continually shift, from global cities such as London, New York and Vancouver to post-Soviet Russia or the high-octane capitalism of 21st-century Asia. It is possible to say without too much exaggeration that we now inhabit a version of the future Gibson first described 25 years ago. No replicants or time travel, but rather an accumulation of smaller changes, the consequences of which are subtle and all-pervasive as technology has increasingly lodged in unanticipated aspects of our lives. As Gibson has observed, the actual future is often more nuanced and unexpected than the imagined future.
        
        The rapid technological and social changes of the past two decades present complex challenges to architectural practice and education. The 1990s in particular were characterized in part by the rejection of history and the announcement of massive, technology-driven change; these claims need to be examined and placed in context. The introduction of the computer has indeed made the design studio a very different place than it was in 1990s. A new generation of teachers and practitioners has emerged, schooled in the creative use of these advanced technologies, but also marked by the theoretical debates of the 1980s and 90s. The speed of information exchange, accelerated by digital technology, has made a discipline already international in its scope fully global. The schools and the profession reacted in complex ways to the events of September 11, 2001, reigniting debates about memory, place, politics and the agency of design. Questions provoked by global urbanization, economic instability and increasing awareness of the environmental crisis have spurred a rethinking of design methodologies and the potential of cross-disciplinary work. Architectural historians are reexamining the utopian and speculative projects of the 1960s and ’70s, and in architecture and industrial design a hands-on, activist culture has arisen, often working with a pragmatic mix of simple technology and global distribution networks to enact change in the developing world. The environmentalism of the 1960s has also been revived, now seen through the lens of landscape, ecology and building performance.

        In short, the field continues to adapt and change. As a way to clarify a past that is still too close for complete historical objectivity, this essay will focus on three areas: the impact of digital technologies, the theory/practice debates, and the emergence of new interdisciplinary approaches to urbanism and the environment. As one who was both a participant and observer in these developments, I bring an informed, even insider’s perspective; but there are undoubtedly important developments left out of my account. 3 At a time of ongoing change, my aim is to identify consequential change and cut through the persistent rhetoric of “the new.”</p>
